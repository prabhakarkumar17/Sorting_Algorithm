# Sorting_Algorithm

This algorithm will reach us to a conclusion that, which sorting algorithm is most efficient for sorting same set of data multiple times.

We will get our final result based upon time taken by each sorting algorithm in ascending order.

Just you have to run "Sorting.java" file the eventually you will get the result
