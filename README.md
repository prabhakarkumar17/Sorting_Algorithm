# Sorting_Algorithm

This algorithm will reach us to the conclusion that which sorting algorithm is most efficient for sorting the same set of data multiple times.

We will get our final result based upon the time taken by each sorting algorithm in ascending order.

Just you have to run the "Sorting.java" file then eventually you will get the result.
